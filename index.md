# Planning a trip makes you 8% happier.

Scientific study has shown that the intention itself or the plan to go on a holiday makes vacationers to be almost as happy as the trip itself.
The study compared vacationers to non-vacationers and the results showed that vacationers had an 8% higher pre-trip happiness score than non-vacationers.

Other studies have also confirmed this psychological phenomenon.
